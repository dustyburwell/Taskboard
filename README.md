Taskboard is intended to be a straighforward Kanban-esque interface for project management. 
It is the aim of this project to be a single wholy encapsulated front end to a REST web
interface. Taskboard will take full advantage of HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript to create
an intuitive, modern web thick-client. The client could, if desired, be run from a user's
computer without any hosting framework whatsoever.

This project will also define a standard REST SPI which, if adhered to, could be used as
the entrypoint into any kind of backend architecture. As an initial offering, an Asp.net
implementation is planned which will act as a proxy to a 
[TFS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_Foundation_Server) instance as that will address
immediate needs for me.
